Note: int *p; is pointed the some garbage value . This is a bad practic instead do this int *p =0 ; null pointer

--> Here I am actually increment the Storage Loacrion Address i.e. if memory address 4 when you increment the 
    Pointer address by +1 then it is will by point 8 address and increase the 4 bytes . 
    (ptr)++;// *ptr = *ptr+1;

--> int arr[10]; cout << arr; will print the by default Fist Element Loaction Array 

--> Intrenal Array formula when I access the value of array  arr[i] = *(arr+i)  or i[arr] = *(i+arr)

--> Address of array can not re-assign 

--> What is Reference Variable?
ans--> Same Memory but different variable name 

There are two ways to pass the value in Functions 

(1) Pass By Value and |(2) Pass By Refernec
You will create a new | Here you pass the same address 
variable means copy   | variable in functions 
variable              |

--> A stack in programming refers to a specific type of data structure and also a memory region used during program execution.

--> The heap, on the other hand, is another memory region in RAM used for dynamically allocated objects that persist beyond function calls.

--> Heap memory will invoked during the new keyword
--> Heap is a Dynamic Mempry and Stack is a Static Memory 
--> One thing Heap Will create a memory but it return the address of memory so for that create a pointer to  storre the address of memory

--> using new ensures that memory is allocated on the heap for the object, and the stack stores a reference to it. ðŸš€
--> In Static Stack Memory memory release automatically but in heap memory You need to release the Memory Manually.

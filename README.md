Note: int *p; is pointed the some garbage value . This is a bad practic instead do this int *p =0 ; null pointer

--> Here I am actually increment the Storage Loacrion Address i.e. if memory address 4 when you increment the 
    Pointer address by +1 then it is will by point 8 address and increase the 4 bytes . 
    (ptr)++;// *ptr = *ptr+1;

--> int arr[10]; cout << arr; will print the by default Fist Element Loaction Array 

--> Intrenal Array formula when I access the value of array  arr[i] = *(arr+i)  or i[arr] = *(i+arr)

--> Address of array can not re-assign 

--> What is Reference Variable?
ans--> Same Memory but different variable name
